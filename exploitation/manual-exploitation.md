# Manual Exploitation

Sometimes there may be an exploit available from searchsploit, or some POC on github, but there won't be a Metasploit module for it. This is when we need to manually run these exploits

## Searchsploit

Searchsploit is great here because when you search for a service, it will also show you the path to some exploit code written for each vulnerability in the path column to the right. Simply copy the code to your working directory

```sh
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/explots/[path] .
```
