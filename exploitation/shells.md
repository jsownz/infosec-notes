# Shells

### Reverse Shell

We are starting a listener on our machine and we are triggering a connection from the target machine to ourselves.

* Useful for internal engagements or when we have access to the firewall we are behind
* Sometimes they don't work for various reasons

### Bind Shell

Opposite of a reverse shell, we connect to the target machine

* Useful if we are able to open a port on the target firewall

### Making our shell more friendly

Usually a reverse shell will not be very friendly, no prompt, no autocomplete or clear, sometimes the echo is weird etc. There are a few days to fix this:

If Python is available on the machine, we can spawn a pty shell:

```sh
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After doing this, there are a few quality of life changes you can make

* background the shell `ctrl+z`
* `stty raw-echo`
* `fg [enter] [enter]`
  * this will bring you back into the shell
* `export TERM=xterm`

If you find that python is not on the machine, you can still get a shell that's a little better:

```sh
script /dev/null -c bash
```
