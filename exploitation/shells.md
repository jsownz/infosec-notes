# Shells

### Reverse Shell

We are starting a listener on our machine and we are triggering a connection from the target machine to ourselves.

* Useful for internal engagements or when we have access to the firewall we are behind
* Sometimes they don't work for various reasons

### Bind Shell

Opposite of a reverse shell, we connect to the target machine

* Useful if we are able to open a port on the target firewall
