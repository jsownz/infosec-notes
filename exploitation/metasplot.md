# Metasplot

## Find an exploitable service

First, we need to find an exploitable service on the machine. The enumeration phase should give us an idea of the services available on the target machine and we can investigate further using searchsploit. This is a command tool that searches exploit-db.com for relevant results.&#x20;

```sh
searchsploit [terms]
```

For instance:

```sh
searchsploit proftp 1.2
```

Also a good idea to first update searchsploit references and exploit code with:

```sh
searchsploit -u
```

## Metasploit

### Launch Metasploit

```sh
msfconsole
```

### Search for the exploit

You've found that there is an existing exploit for the service you're looking for, now you need to see if there is a Metasploit module for it

```sh
msf> search proftp
```

### Select the module

You've found the module, select it to use it

```sh
msf> use [index]
```

### Fill in the options

Now you'll need to look at the options and fill them in

```sh
msf> options
msf> set RHOSTS [target ip / host]
```

Continue through any required options on the module

### Select Targets

Occasionally, you'll have more than one target available - you can see the target selections by using the show command

```sh
msf> show targets
```

### Select the Payload

Now we need to select a payload to send with the exploit. Occasionally, one will be selected automatically and shown in the `options` command. However, this is generally a Staged Payload and may be unstable. To view available payloads, use the show command and select it with use

```sh
msf> set payload [tab to autocomplete]
```

### Exploit

Time to run the exploit

```sh
msf> exploit
```

If the exploit is successful a meterpreter (or whatever type of payload shell you chose) will be spawned and you will be dropped into the shell

### Meterpreter

Meterpreter is great, because it's a shell that's built into Metasploit and comes with many commands built in. You can also have multiple meterpreter sessions. You can background a session by using the `background` command inside of meterpreter. You can use the `sessions` command to view available sessions and select one to interact with

```sh
meterpreter> background
msf> sessions
msf> sessions -i 1
```
