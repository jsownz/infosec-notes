# Work In Progress

This was initially intended for me to replace my notes app that I had, hoping that I would be able to update and search it a little easier - still not sure if that will be the case, but I like the format this has, so we'll see how it goes.

This will likely be changing **A LOT**. I haven't looked at these notes in some time, but I'm getting a little deeper into security again, so I'll be organizing these a bit better. If anyone finds this, you'll likely notice a lot of overlapping information, duplicated information and sometimes even conflicting information. This will probably happen for a while as I figure out how I want to organize the various pages. Anyway, if this is useful to you, enjoy.&#x20;

A lot of the information is gleaned from various boxes and courses I've done - a **HUGE** amount of these notes are from a UDEMY course by [Heath Adams (@thecybermentor)](https://x.com/thecybermentor), which I believe are now a part of his program on his site [TCM Securtiy](https://tcm-sec.com/)
