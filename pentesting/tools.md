# Tools

### Gobuster

#### Virtual Hosts

```
gobuster vhost -u http://[target_IP_address] -w [wordlist_file] --append-domain
```

* `--append-domain` would be used if you're looking for virtual hosts which are subdomains and you use a TLD instead of IP (I think)

#### Subdomains

```
gobuster dns -u [target domain] -w [wordlist]
```

#### Directories

```
gobuster dir -u [target domain] -w [wordlist]
```
