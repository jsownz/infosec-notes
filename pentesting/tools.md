# Tools

### Gobuster

#### Virtual Hosts

```
gobuster vhost -u http://[target_IP_address] -w [wordlist_file] --append-domain
```

* `--append-domain` would be used if you're looking for virtual hosts which are subdomains and you use a TLD instead of IP (I think)

#### Subdomains

```shell-session
gobuster dns -u [target domain] -w [wordlist]
```

#### Directories

```shell-session
gobuster dir -u [target domain] -w [wordlist]
```

***

### Nmap

* network scan
  * `sudo nmap [CIDR ADDR] -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5`
  * using list of hosts
    * `-iL [host list]`
* `-sT` is the most stealthy scan, as it uses the entire TCP handshake to check ports
* `-sA` to bypass many IPS and IDS
* `-Pn` disable ping
* `-n` disable DNS resolution
* `--disable-arp-ping` disable ARP ping, good for investigating further
* `--packet-trace` get more info on send and recv
* `--reason` get more info on the port state
* `-D` decoy - nmap inserts random IPs in the IP header of the scans
* `--source-port` specify a source port, often 53 to slide through dns port
  * can also specify this in netcat when connecting to a port

### WhatWeb

Great for enumeration of websites, should return webserver information and versions, any CMS, etc.

```shell-session
whatweb [target domain]
```
